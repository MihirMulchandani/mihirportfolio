This is my personal portfolio website.

It is built around a simple idea:

**the portfolio itself should follow the same constraints as the systems it presents.**

Everything runs client-side.  
Nothing is tracked.  
Nothing is collected.

The site exists to document work, not users.

---

## How it works (high level)

- Built as a static single-page application
- All content is bundled at build time
- No backend services
- No runtime data fetching
- Hosting platform is treated as untrusted

The site behaves the same on every load.

---

## Design principles

- Client-side execution as the primary boundary
- Constraints over features
- Deterministic behavior
- Minimal dependencies
- Clarity over decoration

If the site needs a backend, something is wrong.

---

## Tech stack

- React + TypeScript
- React Router (HashRouter)
- Tailwind CSS
- Native SVG icons
- Static deployment (Vercel)

---

## Notes

The UI is intentionally minimal.  
The focus is on projects and the ideas behind them, not visual effects.

This repository is not a template or framework.
It is a record of work.
